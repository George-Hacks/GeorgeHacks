George Hacks is a student-led organization at George Washington University that focuses on interdisciplinary healthcare innovation with a social impact. It is known for organizing the George Hacks Medical Solutions Hackathon, an annual event where students from various disciplines collaborate over 24 hours to create innovative solutions to real-world medical challenges. Participants work on diverse problem statements, such as improving patient care processes or developing medical devices, often supported by expert mentors and healthcare organizations.

The hackathon encourages collaboration across fields like engineering, public health, and data science, promoting creativity and practical problem-solving. Themes often align with global issues, such as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, fostering both local and international impact. Students also gain networking opportunities with professionals and hands-on experience in addressing healthcare challenges
