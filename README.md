It is known for organizing the George Hacks Medical Solutions Hackathon, an annual event where students from various disciplines collaborate over 24 hours to create innovative solutions to real-world medical challenges. Participants work on diverse problem statements, such as improving patient care processes or developing medical devices, often supported by expert mentors and healthcare organizations.
